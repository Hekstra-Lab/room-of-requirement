# Tex Template for PhD Thesis

I put this together for my personal use, and then adapted it more generally for anyone to use.

All the useful `.cls` files and other parts are included in the zip archive. I also uploaded the
example PDF to get a sense of what this ends up looking like.

I hope this is useful for anyone that finds it.
